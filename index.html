                My name is Edward Gretsch so my fear things in life are technology and recreational activities. Which in my mind is sort
                of an oxymoron is an almost in a way contradict one another of than the fact that there is technology and recreational industries.
                Because I feel recreational activities and technology are in some ways contradictory of one another I still find both of
                them to be enjoyable. The reason I find recreation and technology both enjoyable is because they are things I can learn about
                as well as grow my skills and physical abilities. Which pushing myself allows me to keep learning and growing to become better
                and better-rounded in my life. Learning is such an integral part of my life that I fully endorse the thought of learning
                and expanding one’s individual self as much as possible because it is the greatest way to make headway in one’s life.
